# NUSvigate
When you are a freshman or simply have a poor sense of directions, you try to look for directions online only to find a NUS map that you are unable to decipher. You seek help from your friends but are still unable to find your way. 

After taking a long time to reach your tutorial room, you realised that you lost your ez-link card on the way there. You are alarmed and not sure which platform or where to go to get it back. You also realise that you are unsure of the student services that are available in NUS, thus feeling out of place.
Many times, we find ourselves lost around NUS, are unsure of where to look for our misplaced items, and are not really aware of the services and events that are offered in school. Also, we might notice some damaged facilities or properties in the school.

Hence, with the integrated application we create, we can access campus directions, a lost and found feature, services information as well as a page that can report fixes conveniently. There will be latest NUS news and events in the application as well.
